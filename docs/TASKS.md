# TASKS.md: What To Actually Work On

This is the source of truth for day-to-day work. Consult PROJECT_STATE.md only when you need the bigger picture behind one of these.

The tasks below, under stories 7, 9, and 12, are drafts written during planning, before this repository's actual code was available to check against. They have not yet been confirmed against the real implementation. Before starting any of them, check them against the current code: some tasks may already be done, some may not apply the way they're written, and some may be missing. Once a story's tasks are confirmed accurate, update its status to Ready in PROJECT_STATE.md.

"Next available task" means the earliest unchecked box under a Ready or In Progress story.

## Story 7: Azure migration

- [ ] Confirm the current Postgres host (see story 23, may need the schema reconciliation done first)
- [ ] Provision an Azure Container Apps environment
- [ ] Deploy the core service container
- [ ] Deploy the AI microservice container, same environment, for internal networking
- [ ] Provision Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server, enable pgvector
- [ ] Migrate data to the new Postgres instance
- [ ] Verify both services and the frontend work end to end against Azure
- [ ] Decommission Fly.io once verified

## Story 9: DJ real YouTube link-out

- [ ] Remove the current embedded/hidden iframe from the DJ view
- [ ] Add an "open in YouTube" link-out for remote sessions, opening a new browser tab

- [ ] Add deep-link handling for in-person sessions (Android intent, iOS universal link, fallback to a plain browser link)
- [ ] Update QR code generation to point at the real YouTube URL
- [ ] Replace the automatic reveal-on-song-end behavior with the manual WebSocket reveal trigger

## Story 12: Voice chat

- [ ] Implement WebRTC signaling over the existing WebSocket layer
